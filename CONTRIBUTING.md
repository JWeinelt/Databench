## 1. Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to follow our **Code of Conduct**:

- Treat everyone with kindness.
- Avoid personal attacks, harassment, or offensive language.

## 2. How to contribute

You can contribute in several ways:

- **Report bugs or issues** – Help us find and fix problems.
- **Request features** – Suggest new functionality or improvements.
- **Improve documentation** – Fix typos, clarify explanations, or add examples.
- **Write code** – Add new features, fix bugs, or optimize performance.

### Getting the code

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork:

```git
git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DataBench.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DataBench.git)

```

## 3. Development Guidelines

- **Coding style:** Follow the existing style of the project (indentation, naming conventions, comments). Consistency is more important than perfection.
- **Documentation:** Update documentation whenever you add or change features.
- **Testing:** Add tests whenever possible for new features or bug fixes.
- **Dependencies:** Avoid unnecessary external libraries unless required.
- **Commits:** Use clear, structured commit messages. Recommended format:

```
feat(example): add plugin search by keyword
fix(parser): handle empty CSV rows correctly
improvement(core): optimize database import speed
docs: update README with new examples
```

> Prefixes like `feat`, `fix`, `improvement`, or `docs` help keep the project history clear.

## 4. Pull Requests

When your changes are ready:

1. Push your branch to your fork:

```git
git push origin feat/my-feature
```

2. Open a Pull Request on the main DataBench repository.
3. In your PR description, explain:
   - What you changed
   - Why it is useful
   - Any additional notes (e.g., testing instructions)
4. Wait for review. Maintainers may request changes or ask questions – this is normal and expected.

---

## 5. Issues

- Before opening a new issue, **check existing issues** to avoid duplicates.
- Use clear and descriptive titles.
- Include relevant details such as error messages, steps to reproduce, or screenshots.
- Label issues if possible (bug, feature, question).

---

## 6. Communication

- Join our community on Discord (or other platforms) to discuss ideas.
- Be patient and polite – maintainers are often volunteers.
- Ask questions if something is unclear – clarity is better than guessing.

> [!TIP]
> Start small! Even fixing typos, improving documentation, or adding a single example can make a big difference. Every contribution counts.
